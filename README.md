# Generating-Hand-Written-Digits-using-DCGAN

Project Overview<br>
This project demonstrates how to generate realistic handwritten digits (like those from the MNIST dataset) using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).
DCGANs are a powerful type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that use convolutional layers, making them especially effective for image generation tasks.

Technologies Used
- TensorFlow 2.x / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- MNIST Dataset
